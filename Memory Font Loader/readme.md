## Introduction

The advantage of this script over others, such as Wachunga's font-install script, is that it does not require a administrator privileges to use the fonts, nor a restart of the game after running.

## Features
* Automatically load all fonts found in user-defined folder
* Supports TrueType (*.ttf) and OpenType(*.otf) fonts
* Does not require Administrator privileges
* Does not require a game restart
* Plug & play
