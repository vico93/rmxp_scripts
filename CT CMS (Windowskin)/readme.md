## Thanks to 
* Squall/Selwyn for his Cursor Script
* RPG Advocate for his Party Members change script
* MeisMe for fixing some bugs and helping me
* Squaresoft for the pictures

## Setup
* You need to copy and paste the files/folders *inside* `assets` folder to your project;
* Place the scripts on your Script Editor **in order**!
* To change filenames and such, edit the first script.

## Instructions
* Icons of the characters are used in the save menu.
* Make sure you put them in the icon folder and name them
* like you name your character file, for example the icon for
* Arshes would be 001-Fighter01
* For the chapter function, just use $game_system = "desired filename"
* in a call script command and then the savefile will have the name 
* you choose.
